Whisper(openAI) model:
Whisper OpenAI speech to text model is a state-of-the-art machine learning model developed by OpenAI to transcribe whispered speech into text. It is an extension of the OpenAI GPT-3 language model, which uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text based on a given prompt.
The Whisper OpenAI speech to text model is specifically designed to recognize and transcribe whispered speech accurately, even in noisy environments. It uses a combination of advanced neural network architectures, including Transformer and LSTM models, to process and interpret the whispered speech.

NLU model:
For the intent and entity classification, SpaCy is used. Spacy's entity recognition is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that identifies and extracts named entities, such as people, organizations, locations, and other specific information, from text. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the linguistic features of a text and classify it into predefined categories. To tailor our own enities enitity ruler was used.
